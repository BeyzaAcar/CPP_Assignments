hello teacher, instead of adding too many comment lines to my code, I thought I would put a readme file again.

In my record file it stores the movement of the last tetromino and how much it moves in total.

Like my code last time it also includes overlap_control function, this function adds the block to the board certainly if there is an overlapping block while scrolling down.

There is a block_letter in classes because I keep the type (ie letter) of that tetromino in a variable and fill that tetromino with x so that the last added tetromino is different from the others. for example like this:

(To make it more understandable to you, I replaced spaces with dots and add spaces between letters) !!!!
the actual tetromino :      Tetromino objects outside the Tetromino class (last_block):  
	
	. . . .                        . . . .  
	. . . .                        . . . .
	O O . .                        x x . . 
	O O . .                        x x . .



Thus, the last added block on the board does not have a chance to be confused and the downward movement continues. As soon as it conflicts, it stops and the xs are replaced with the char in the block_letter variable that we have stored before.
e.g :

BLOCK_LETTER = 'o'

LAST_BLOCK =    . . . . 
                . . . . 
                x x . . 
                x x . . 
               
certain_merge() replaced x s with block_letter which equals to 'o'
